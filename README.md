# Hackathon_BugHunters
Automated tests for Hackathon app.

APPLICATION STORY
Our major client in the hospitality industry asked us to create an app for their new accommodation, in the beautiful surroundings of the English Forest, which needed to be online within 14 days of receiving the brief. The client is in a real hurry as the hunting season is about to start and people from all over the world flock to these parts to hunt wild game, and this is an opportunity to let Three Foxes Lounge know about it. If we had failed to deliver this application, our client would have lost hundreds of thousands of Euros and the opportunity for a good start to a new business, not to mention the reputation that comes with such a facility, as this is accommodation for a select company.
Our developers managed to develop this application in 4 days. However, before we hand it over to our client, we need to test it thoroughly so that we can be sure we deliver it to the required quality. You are here to test our new app, provide feedback to the developers and save our client's reputation and more importantly the very operation of their new facility in the middle of the English woods.
BACKGROUND
Create a comprehensive test plan to test the app

which will be used primarily for booking accommodation at our client's hotels. As our work with this client will continue after the delivery of this app and the project will continue to run, look further into the future. The development of this application does not end today.
